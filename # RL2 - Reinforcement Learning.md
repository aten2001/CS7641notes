# RL1 - Reinforcement Learning

Think of RL as a API (Application Programmer Interface)

model (T, R) -> Planner -> Policy

Transitions \<s, a, r, s' \>* -> Learner -> polict

## API



## Approaches to RL



## A new kind of Value function



## Q Learning



## Estimating Q from Transitions



## Learning incrementally



## Q Learning Convergence



## Choosing Actions



## Greedy Exploration
