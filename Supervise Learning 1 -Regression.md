# Supervise Learning 2 - Regression
linear regression and function approximation

regression misused named. Owes to the fact that extremely tall/short peoples' childrens' height regresses (tends toward the average i.e. children of tall people shorter than tall person, taller than avg). (slope of parent height to child height approx. 2/3)

When this relationship was discovered other mathemticians/scientist stole the term regression to mean finding mathematical relationship to describe physical phenomenon.

Finding the best Fit (Loss or Error function)


typically square is used for error
```
E(c) = sum_i^n (y_i - c)^2
```

Take the derivative and find where derivative = 0 (minimum)
