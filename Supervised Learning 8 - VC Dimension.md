# Supervised Learning 8 - VC Dimension

## Infinite hypothesis space

last time we found that:

m >= 1 / \epsilon (ln|H| + ln(1 / \delta))

## Maybe it's not so bad



## Power of a hypothesis space



## What does VC stand for?



## Internal training



## Linear separators



## The ring



## Polygons



## Sample complexity



## VC of finite H
