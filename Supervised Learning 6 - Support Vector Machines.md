# Supervise Learning 5 - Support Vector Machines

## Introduction

Given a linearly seperable data set there be potentially infinite ways of seperating data. How would you draw the best line of fit? You would want the line that provides the biggest buffer between any of your data. A line that gets closer to the data can be thought of trusting the data too much or overfitting. This example of overfitting is a bit different than what we've previously seen.
