# Supervise Learning 5 - Ensemble Learning

## Introduction

Identify simple rules that identify a small cases of classification, but not always completely accurate. But it can be difficult to combine a bunch of small individual rules to make a more complicated wholistic ensemble of rules to tackle a problem.

There are similarities to Neural nets and decision trees. The difference is typically neural nets you have the network built and the nodes are trying to learn the right weights and with a decision tree you're building up rules as you go along. With ensemble learning you're building up rules as well.

## Simple rules

1. Learn over a subset of the data... repeat
2. Combine for a complex rule

We focus on a smaller subset because it can be harder to learn a simple rule if you're looking at too much data.
