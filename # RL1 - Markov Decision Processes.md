# RL1 - Markov Decision Processes

## Decision Making & Reinforcement Learning

Three types of learning:
- Supervised Learning: Function approximation. Given x and y, fund a function f(x) to map x to y
- Unsupervised learning: Given x, find f(x) that gives you a compact description i.e. clustering or description
- Reinforcement learning: Superficially resembles supervised learning in that given "pairs" of data. But instead of x and y, given x's and z's to find a function f that achieves y. Reinforcement learning is one method of achieving decision making

## The world

Gridworld is a commonly used problem setting for reinforcement learning problems. Consists of:
- Start cell
- Normal cells
- Walls and blocked of cells
- Goal cell(s)
- "Lose" cell(s)
