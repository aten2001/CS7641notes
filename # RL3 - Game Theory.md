# RL3 - Game Theory

## What is Game Theory?

Various definitions:

- Mathematics of conflicts or conflicts of interest when making optimal interests
- Single agents -> Multiple agents (up until this point kind of assuming other agents are a part of the world)
- Economics (& politics)
- Increasingly a part of AI

Ways of thinking when you're not the only thing thinking with intention i.e. there are other agents acting either against or with you.
