# RL3 - Game Theory

## What is Game Theory?

Various definitions:

- Mathematics of conflicts or conflicts of interest when making optimal interests
- Single agents -> Multiple agents (up until this point kind of assuming other agents are a part of the world)
- Economics (& politics)
- Increasingly a part of AI

Ways of thinking when you're not the only thing thinking with intention i.e. there are other agents acting either against or with you.

## A simple game

Two agents A & B. Game Tree, 2  nodes representing states, edges representing actions. Leaves = A's reward & B's - reward.

This is a 2 player  zero sum finite deterministic game of perfect information.

This is the simplest possible game. In MDP we had policies. In Game Theory we have strategies.

Ultimately though, a game can be captured in a matrix of all strategies a and b can choose along the axes of the matrix and the outcome of the games per those strategies as the cells of the matrix.
