# Supervised Learning 7 - Computational Learning Theory

## Introduction

Different learners produce different outputs for classifying data.

### Learning Theory

Three questions or issues:

1. Define learning gproblems
2. Show specific algorithms work
3. Show these problems are fundamentally hard

Tools for analyzing learning problems are similara to tools for analyzing algorithms in computing.

Some of the resources useful in analyzing learning algoriths are time and space just like normal algorithms. Furthermore, learning algorithms are measured in terms of the number of samaples or data they need to be effective.
